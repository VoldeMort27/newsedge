                                <p>Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are popular on the dark web
                                    because they allow for anonymous transactions, unlike traditional payment methods.
                                    Over 95% of transactions on the dark web are made using Bitcoin. However, there are
                                    challenges to using cryptocurrencies on the dark web, such as the volatility of
                                    their value, which makes it difficult to price goods and services. Additionally,
                                    while transactions themselves are anonymous, there is still a risk of marketplaces
                                    being hacked or users’ cryptocurrency wallets being stolen. Despite these
                                    challenges, cryptocurrencies continue to play a major role on the dark web as they
                                    allow users to evade traditional financial institutions and engage in anonymous
                                    transactions.</p><br>

                                <p>The dark web poses several risks, including the possibility of being caught by law
                                    enforcement despite using encryption and other security measures. Law enforcement
                                    agencies have developed ways to track and monitor dark web activities, such as
                                    tracking IP addresses and using other forms of surveillance. Browsing through
                                    illegal content and purchasing illegal goods on the dark web can also result in law
                                    enforcement attention and potential criminal charges. It is important to be aware of
                                    these risks when using the dark web.
