                    <strong>The Perfect way to manage the Stress

                    </strong>
                    <p>People talk a lot about stress, but what does it actually mean? Stress is something that is very much personal to us and we experience it in different ways. Stress is essentially when a situation, pressure or change exceeds our coping abilities.



                    </p>
                    <p>For example: Take a rollarcoaster ride you might have two people that go on a rolercoaster together, one person may take a genuine enjoyment out of that experience. Other people might take a genuine sense of fear and anxiety. The rollercoaster itself doesn't change but our perceptions of it will differ. The same can be said for other stressful situation.

                    </p>

                    <p>Ultimately depends on your perception of that situation that determines whether or not you see it as a stressor. Of course, the rollercoaster example is an example of short-term stress, which is isolation may not cause any harm whatsoever. It's only when stress accumlates beyond your coping abilities and without adequate recovery, the stress can become a problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stress is likely to occur after an accumulation of life changing events. Those events can be both positive and negative, it might include a business realignment, a  promotion at work, or even something enjoyable such as a holiday or a Christmas break. What matters is that there's a change to your normal routine. When a number of changes to your life happen within a short space of time, that's when it can bave an impact on your resilience and your stress. We all know stress can make us feel under pressure, agitated and sometimes overwhelmed.
                    </p>

                    <p>The question is how does stress affect our body and our mind and what can we do about it? </p>
                </div>
                <!--box-1-------------->
                <div class="article-text-box">
                    <strong> How does stress affect our body and our mind and what can we do about it? 


                    </strong>
                    <p>Within the body you have the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. Within the central nervous system you have the autonomic nervous system, which is regulating things that are outside of your control. Things like blinking, breathing, and your heart beat. Within the autonomic nervous system you have two particular branches. One is the sympathetic nervous system, that's know as the fight or flight system. The other is the parasympathetic nervous system, that is the rest and digest system and although they interact with each other they both have different roles.</p>
                    <p> The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for increasing the heart rate, increasing blood pressure and increasing blood sugar to help you perform when stress hits. The rest and digest system is responsible for supperssing heart rate and bringing you back down to what's known as homeostasis.

                    </p>
                    <p>DHEA is an immune system boosting hormone which means it helps stave off the development of lifestyle related diseases. The problem here is that DHEA and cortisol and relaease from the same area of the body, the adrenal gland.This means that when someone is exposed to chronic stress, without the ability to  recover and adapt to that stress the DHEA is not being released. This means that the risk of diseases is increased.
                    </p>

                    <p>Excess of  cortisol and chronic stress can increase the risk of stokes and heart form happenig. The reason being when cortisol is released it creates an inflammatory response within the arterial lining. That inflammation could then lead to an increased cholesterol. If that cholesterol becomes unstable and breakes off and travel down to the smaller arteries of the heart or of hte brain, that could result in the stroke or the heart attack.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stress can also have an effect on the way that your brain functions. Normally when you experience a situation or a stimulus it goes via the thalamus and then into the carebral cortex. The outer part of hte brain is responsible for high level thinking, such as strategy, executive decision making and creativity. The problem is when we're under stress that whole system is bypassed and is goes via the amygdala. The amygdala is very closely linked to your fight or flight response. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore when you are under stress, the amygdala will result in your fight or flight response, engaging more rapidly and therefore you don't have the outer human thinking that you would normally have. As a result you might act in a way that you would later regret. Now that we know a bit more about stress, the question is what can we do to improve our resilience to improve our ability to deal with pressure?
                    </p>

                        </strong>
                        <p>When it comes to effective stress management, it's important to focus on the factors that are within your perceived control.


                        </p>
                        <p>Our factor that is particularly useful to improve is sleep quality. Sleep deprivation can lead to increase activation of hte amygdala, which is of course responsible for the increase in the fight or flight reaction. By improving your sleep quality you help to reduce the activation of the amygdala which of course is linked to the fight or flight response.

                        </p>
<p>Low to moderate exercise can be very useful for stress management.
</p>

<p>Exercises that place a focus on muscle tension and deep breathing, such a yoga for example, are very good because they drive up the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Unlike high intensity exercise, which drives up the activation of the fight or flight system. 
</p>

<p>Therefore going for a light to brisk walk before bedtime can be a more effective stress relief than going for high intensity run.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, performing regular exercise can be a good distraction from the stresses in your life. There are lifestyle factor to consider too.
</p>

<p>Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol are often used as the de-stress technique. However, htey actually drive up the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and in doing so exacerbate stress more than help it.
</p>

<p>Therefore the casual cup of tea or the occasional glass of wine to help de-stress after a long day might not be as effective as we once thought.
</p>

<p>Taking these factors onboard and modifying you behaviour will help you to improve your ability to prepare for, react to and recover from stress in your life, ultimately improving you resilience.</p>
